# DeepQuant

This is code and presentation for 2022 MCM(Mathematical Contest in Modeling) competition about quant stategy.
Firstly, we designed prediction model by comparing performance between traditional ARIMA and deep learning LSTM model.
Then, for how to buy and sell, we used greedy and dynamic programming method to make decisions.
Luckly, the result is not bad from $1000 to $20000000+ dollar within five years, you can redo it easily.

If you have some questions and suggestions, please contact me by wenxin0727@connect.hku.hk.
